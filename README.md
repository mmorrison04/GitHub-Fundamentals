## Automated ELK Stack Deployment

The files in this repository were used to configure the network depicted below.

**Note**: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace `diagram_filename.png` with the name of your diagram image file.  

![TODO: Update the path with the name of your diagram](Images/diagram_filename.png)

These files have been tested and used to generate a live ELK deployment on Azure. They can be used to either recreate the entire deployment pictured above. Alternatively, select portions of the _____ file may be used to install only certain pieces of it, such as Filebeat.

  - _TODO: Enter the playbook file._/etc/ansible/

- Description of the Topology
- Access Policies
- ELK Configuration
  - Beats in Use

### Description of the Topology
The main purpose of this network is to expose a load-balanced and monitored instance of DVWA, the D*mn Vulnerable Web Application.

Load balancing ensures that the application will be highly responsive, in addition to restricting _____ to the network.
- Load balancers protect against potential denial-of-service attacks by shifting the attack traffic. The advantage of a jumpbox is that it is a secure and controlled environment to access other VMâ€™s within your network remotely. 

Integrating an ELK server allows users to easily monitor the vulnerable VMs for changes to the _____ and system _____.
- Filebeat watches for information that has been changed along with when that information was changed in the file system. 
-  Metricbeat puts the metrics and statistics that is has collected and puts them into the specified location. 

The configuration details of each machine may be found below.
_Note: Use the [Markdown Table Generator](http://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables) to add/remove values from the table_.

| Name     | Function | IP Address | Operating System |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------|
| Jump Box | Gateway  | 10.0.0.1   | Linux            |
| Web-1    | Server   | 10.0.0.8   | Linux            |
| Web-2    | Server   | 10.0.0.9   | Linux            |
| Web-3    | Server   | 10.0.0.7   | Linux            |
| Elk      | Server   | 10.1.0.4   | Linux            |

### Access Policies
The machines on the internal network are not exposed to the public Internet. 

Only the _____ machine can accept connections from the Internet. Access to this machine is only allowed from the following IP addresses:
- Public IP address : 71.126.155.137

Machines within the network can only be accessed by _____.
- The machine I allowed to access my ELK VM was the Jump Box VM : 10.0.0.1

A summary of the access policies in place can be found in the table below.

| Name     | Publicly Accessible | Allowed IP Addresses |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Jump Box | Yes                 | Home IP              |
| Web-1    | No                  | 10.0.0.1             |
| Web-2    | No                  | 10.0.0.1             |
| Web-3    | No                  | 10.0.0.1             |

### Elk Configuration
Ansible was used to automate configuration of the ELK machine. No configuration was performed manually, which is advantageous because...
- The main advantage of automating configuration with Ansible is that you are able to access commands in multiple servers from one single playbook.

The playbook implements the following tasks:
- Install: docker.io
- Install: python3-pip
- Install: docker
- Increase virtual memory: sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
- Launch Elk container: elk


The following screenshot displays the result of running `docker ps` after successfully configuring the ELK instance.

**Note**: The following image link needs to be updated. Replace `docker_ps_output.png` with the name of your screenshot image file.  


![TODO: Update the path with the name of your screenshot of docker ps output](Images/docker_ps_output.png)


### Target Machines & Beats
This ELK server is configured to monitor the following machines:
- Web-1: 10.0.0.8
- Web-2: 10.0.0.9
- Web-3: 10.0.0.9

We have installed the following Beats on these machines:
- Filebeat and Metricbeat

These Beats allow us to collect the following information from each machine:
- Metricbeat collects the metrics and statistics and Filebeat records the changes that are made.


### Using the Playbook
In order to use the playbook, you will need to have an Ansible control node already configured. Assuming you have such a control node provisioned: 

SSH into the control node and follow the steps below:
- Copy the _____ file to _____.
- Update the _____ file to include...
- Run the playbook, and navigate to ____ to check that the installation worked as expected.

_TODO: Answer the following questions to fill in the blanks:_
- Which file is the playbook? Where do you copy it?
	- /etc/ansible/file/filebeat_configuration.yml
- Which file do you update to make Ansible run the playbook on a specific machine? How do I specify which machine to install the ELK server on versus which to install Filebeat on?
	- The file that you update is /etc/ansible/host and you add the IP addresses under the webserver title
- Which URL do you navigate to in order to check that the ELK server is running?
	- www.publicip:5601

-	As a **Bonus**, provide the specific commands the user will need to run to download the playbook, update the files, etc.
    o	Ansible-playbook filebeat_playbook.yml
